# Project Plan for Awesome GitHub Lists Ranker Chrome Extension

## 1. Setup & Environment Configuration
- Clone the boilerplate repository from https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite
- Set up the project structure, install dependencies (React, Vite), and configure the Chrome extension manifest
- Establish version control and branch management
- Configure a local development environment with hot-reloading for iterative testing

## 2. MVP Phase – Console Output
- Implement basic extension startup logic that outputs key data and status messages to the browser console
- Verify extension loading in Chrome's developer mode with clear console logs
- Develop initial unit tests for core functionality and logging

## 3. MVP Phase – Chrome Extension Popup UI
- Create a basic React component for the popup interface
- Display placeholder content (e.g., a sample GitHub list) and static metrics within the popup
- Implement state management for future dynamic data updates
- Conduct UI tests to ensure the popup behaves as expected across different states

## 4. Data Integration & Metrics Calculation
- Integrate with the GitHub API to fetch repository details and awesome list data
- Develop a data parsing module to extract stars and other metrics
- Implement a ranking algorithm that sorts lists based on stars and additional criteria
- Test API responses using mock data to simulate different scenarios and ensure accuracy

## 5. Content Script Development – Page Injection
- Develop a content script to inject interactive components directly into GitHub pages
- Design UI elements (e.g., overlays or sidebars) that display ranked lists and metrics on the target page
- Ensure seamless communication between background scripts, the popup, and the content script
- Test injection across different GitHub list pages for responsiveness and compatibility

## 6. Enhanced Features & User Interaction
- Expand popup functionality with filtering, sorting, and customizable ranking options
- Add interactive elements such as user input fields for adjusting metric weights or star thresholds
- Improve UI/UX with refined designs, loading indicators, and error handling
- Implement additional views (e.g., detailed metrics modals) as needed and test for usability

## 7. Comprehensive Testing & Quality Assurance
- Develop a suite of unit tests covering core modules (API integration, data parsing, ranking logic)
- Create integration tests to verify communication between the popup, content script, and background processes
- Conduct manual testing across various browsers and operating systems
- Use testing frameworks (e.g., Jest for unit tests, Cypress for end-to-end tests) to automate regression testing
- Schedule regular testing sessions throughout development to catch and resolve issues early

## 8. Documentation & Deployment Preparation
- Write detailed developer documentation covering the codebase, architecture, and testing procedures
- Prepare user documentation including installation instructions, usage guides, and troubleshooting tips
- Package the extension according to Chrome Web Store guidelines and conduct a final round of release-candidate testing
- Deploy the extension to the Chrome Web Store and set up channels for user feedback

## 9. Post-Deployment Maintenance & Iteration
- Monitor user feedback and analytics to identify areas for improvement
- Plan for regular updates and bug fixes based on user reports and automated test results
- Maintain and expand the testing suite and CI/CD pipeline to support ongoing development and ensure high-quality releases
